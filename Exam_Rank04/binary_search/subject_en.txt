--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a function that searches for a given value in a binary search tree.
The function should return 1 if the value is found in the tree, otherwise it
should return 0.

The function should be declared as follows:
int search_binary_tree(t_btree *root, int value);

ft_btree.h:

typedef struct s_btree 
{
	int					value;
	struct s_btree		*left;
	struct s_btree		*right;
}t_btree;

The tree will not be ordered in any specific way.

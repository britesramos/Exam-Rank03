--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes one string in arguments.
The string will contain HTML tags and some content.
The program return 0 if the HTML tags are properly nested and closed in the
correct order, otherwise it returns 1.
If there are no arguments the program returns 1.

<test> is a opening tag
</test> is a closing tag

'<img>' is an exception to the rule, it's a self closing tag.
A self closing tag is a tag thta has no content and is closed immediately.

<test><img text text></test> is valid.

An openning tag must always be closed by the corresponding closing tag in
the correct order. A string that does not contain any tag is considered as a 
correctly formatted string.

Examples:
./html_validator "<h1></h1>"; echo $?
0

./html_validator "<img balblabla><h1></h1>"; echo $?
0

./html_validator "<html><head>"; echo $?
1
